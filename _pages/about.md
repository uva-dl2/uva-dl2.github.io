# UvA-DL2 Blogposts

The Machine Learning community is currently experiencing a
[reproducibility crisis](https://neuripsconf.medium.com/designing-the-reproducibility-program-for-neurips-2020-7fcccaa5c6ad)
and a reviewing crisis [[Littman, 2021]](#Litt). Because of the highly competitive and noisy
reviewing process of ML conferences [[Tran et al., 2020]](#Tran), researchers have an incentive to
oversell their results, slowing down the progress and diminishing the
integrity of the scientific community. Moreover with the growing number
of papers published and submitted at the main ML conferences [[Lin et al., 2020]](#Lin), it has
become more challenging to keep track of the latest advances in the
field.

Blog posts are becoming an increasingly popular and useful way to talk
about science [[Brown and Woolston, 2018]](#Brow).
They offer substantial value to the scientific community
by providing a flexible platform to foster open, human, and transparent
discussions about new insights or limitations of a scientific
publication. However, because they are not as recognized as standard
scientific publications, only a minority of researchers manage to
maintain an active blog and get visibility for their efforts. Many are
well-established researchers ([Francis Bach](https://francisbach.com/),
[Ben Recht](https://www.argmin.net/), [Ferenc
Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/), [Lilian
Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/)) or big corporations that
leverage entire teams of graphic designers designer and writers to
polish their blogs ([Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/?page=1),
[Google AI](https://ai.googleblog.com/),
[DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/blog),
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/)). As a result, the incentives for
writing scientific blog posts are largely personal; it is unreasonable
to expect a significant portion of the machine learning community to
contribute to such an initiative when everyone is trying to establish
themselves through publications.

## Why blogposts in a deep learning course?
